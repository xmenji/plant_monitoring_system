# plant_monitoring_system
ENGR 478 Term Project (Fall 2020)

The goal of this project is to create a small-scale plant monitoring system that will measure values such as the temperature, soil moisture, and the amount of sun the plant is getting. 
The project will also meet the requirements for this class by implementing a real-time system, using software interrupts, and interfacing external sensors to the microcontroller.


The term project requirements include:
A real-time system based on one or multiple  TI Tiva TM4c Launchpads
The system must have interrupt routines
The system must integrate at least two of the following components:
Any type of serial interfaces
Power management
ADC
Input/Output devices (LCD displays, sensors, motors)
Input?Output circuits 
Wireless modules
